Pipline ordered in steps followed with code and short descrtiption

In this report we were given a fasta file, belonging to the Nematode species which we identified using blast. 
With this file(contig07), we have the aim of recognizing to which gene annotations it corresponds to using ab-initio tools. 
Then, to use a protein blast to characterize the annotations by function.

#Step 1: GeneID and Fgenesh predictions: we run them on both servers providing the contig07.fa file.

#Step 2: To decide which of the two predictions is more suitable, we need to perform a sequence alignment using t-coffee.
We compare the two resulting GFF files, looking for common genomic regions to facilitate the alignment.
We select the first three exons of the second gene from the GeneID output and the three exons of the first gene of the Fgenesh output.

#Step 3: We create a GFF file to store the output content from GeneID and a FASTA file to store the content of the Fgensh for those genes.
$ gedit geneID_celegans.gff
$ gedit fgenesh_celegans.fa

#Step 4: Obtain a FASTA from the GFF generated by GeneID
$ bedtools getfasta -fi contig07.fa -bed geneID_celegans.gff > geneID_celegans.fa

#Step 5: Concatenate exons of the resulting FASTA
$ sed -e '2,$s/>.*//'geneID_celegans.fa|grep -v'^$' > geneID_celegans_singleLine.fa

#Step 6:
